The link to the quiz is: [https://twitter.com/bayer\_julia/status/1693745209232769182/](https://twitter.com/bayer\_julia/status/1693745209232769182/).&#x20;

I started off by reviewing the image behind the bench:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

That did not get me any results. I then looked into the building:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Reverse image searching this led me to find a person's blog: [https://alexislawrence.com/2020/03/29/in-isolation-but-not-alone/](https://alexislawrence.com/2020/03/29/in-isolation-but-not-alone/):

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The building seems to look the same from the side. If we look closer at the original image, this does seem like a possibility:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

It definitely feels like I am on the correct path with this. I then need to find out what this image is. After reverse searching the image, I was able to see the following:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the site highlighted above, I was able to see the image clearer and also see where it was located at:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>



Looking for this on Google Maps, I was able to find it as well:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (7).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Going down the road, I was able to find where the image was taken:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The image was not there, however, when I look at it from another angle, I was able to find it:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The final location can be found using Google Earth. I used Google Earth, went to this location, and saw the DMS value. Here are the values:

```
Latitude:  41.3852778
Longitude: 2.183611111111111

Latitude:  41 23 07
Longitude: 2 11 01

### Task 1: Translation & Shifting

```aspnet
c4n y0u c4p7u23 7h3 f149?
```

This seems to be in leetspeak format. I manually was able to convert it, but you can use a website such as [this one](https://www.dcode.fr/leet-speak-1337) to decode it.  I then got the flag:

```aspnet
01101100 01100101 01110100 01110011 00100000 01110100 01110010 01111001 00100000 01110011 01101111 01101101 01100101 00100000 01100010 01101001 01101110 01100001 01110010 01111001 00100000 01101111 01110101 01110100 00100001
```

This seems to be in binary format. I looked for a binary to ascii converter online.

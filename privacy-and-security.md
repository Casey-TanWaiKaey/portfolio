# Privacy & Security

## Introduction

I take privacy and security a bit seriously. With that being said, this page is to show my setup in terms of privacy. It definitely can be better, but this is what I use.

## Windows

I recently had an issue with my machine where I was unable to boot back into my Windows machine due to something being corrupted. I then realized it would be a mission for me to remember all of the software that I had installed prior to the Windows being corrupted. This is why suggest having a **text file \(.txt or .md\) or any other form of documentation to have inventory of all of your software that you downloaded.** That is what I do now and have it on a backup drive alongside folders that are important to me \(school, work, etc.\)

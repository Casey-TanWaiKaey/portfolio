# Privacy & Security

## Introduction

I take privacy and security a bit seriously. With that being said, this page is to show my setup in terms of privacy. It definitely can be better, but this is what I use.

## General Privacy/Security

### Passwords

It is hard to have different passwords for every single website and still be able to remember all of them. For this reason I use [**Bitwarden**](https://bitwarden.com/). I actually use this along with [**KeePassXC**](https://keepassxc.org/). They way I have it setup is that   **** 

## Windows

I recently had an issue with my machine where I was unable to boot back into my Windows machine due to something being corrupted. I then realized it would be a mission for me to remember all of the software that I had installed prior to the Windows being corrupted. This is why suggest having a **text file \(.txt or .md\) or any other form of documentation to have inventory of all of your software that you downloaded.** That is what I do now and have it on a backup drive alongside folders that are important to me \(school, work, etc.\)

### SSD or Hard Drive Encryption \(or USB\)

Encryption is the idea of "scrambling data so that only authorized parties can understand the information. In technical terms, it is the process of converting human-readable plaintext to incomprehensible text, also known as ciphertext" \([link](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/)\). I have this setup on my Windows SSD that way **HAVE TO** enter a password into my PC before I can get access to my Windows Login page. I use [**VeraCrypt**](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html) for this. I followed the tutorial [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/6169/use-truecrypt-to-secure-your-data/) for my own setup. Depends on what Wipe mode you choose the longer this can take. I do not plan on having this for much longer, as I am planning on switching over to Linux. You can use this for USB as well, which is great. The only bad part about this is that everytime you would have to get a file off of your encrypted drive, you will have to wait for 30 seconds to 1 minute \(depending on your resources\) for Veracrypt to decrypt the drive.

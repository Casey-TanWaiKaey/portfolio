# Keylogger

### Windows

The following are code that I have modified from [this website](https://www.andreafortuna.org/2019/05/22/how-a-keylogger-works-a-simple-powershell-example/) to fit my needs. I have made the Powershell script to use the keylogger code, but then send the code to a webhook.site website. This is meant to be used with a rubber ducky that way you can plug it in, and in 10 seconds be out of there with the keylogger up and running. The rubber ducky I will be using is a ATTINY85 Micro-controller. Using the Arduino IDE you can flash the code onto the micro-controller.

## Vulnerability

I was able to pick this lock one pin at at a time using the Covert Instrument top-of-the-keyway tension tool and a short rake. In addition, I was able to rake the lock using a top-of-the-keyway tension tool from the Covert Instrument kit and a quad rake. **The tension needed to pick this lock is on the higher end.** I felt like I was about to break my tension tool due to the tension I needed to keep the driver pins above the shear line.

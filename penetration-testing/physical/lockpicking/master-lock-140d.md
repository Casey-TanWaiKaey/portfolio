## Vulnerability

I was able to pick this lock one pin at at a time using the Covert Instrument top-of-the-keyway tension tool and a short rake. In addition, I was able to rake the lock using a top-of-the-keyway tension tool from the Covert Instrument kit and a quad rake. **The tension needed to pick this lock is on the lower end. A small constant nudge is enough to hold the driver pins above the shear line**. There is another vulnerability I was able to notice in this lock. I was able to access the bolt/latch and release the shackle, allowing me to unlock the lock without turning the plug.
